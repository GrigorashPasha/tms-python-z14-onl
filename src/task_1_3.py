The formula for calculating the volume of a cube
if you only know the length of the edge: V = a ⋅ a ⋅ a = a ** 3
Where 'a' is length of the edge
Where 'V' is volume of cube

The area of the side surface of the cube is equal to the number 
of side faces multiplied by the square of the edge: S = 4 * a ** 2
